### Number guesser is a game written in Javascritp, HTML and CSS. 
The goal of the game is to guess which number the computer has randomly generated. The random number is selected from a range the user provides at the game's start.

If the user guesses correctly, the game increases the difficulty by increasing the range of numbers it can select from then regenerates a new random number.

At any point the user can click 'Reset' to refresh the page and start the game again.
